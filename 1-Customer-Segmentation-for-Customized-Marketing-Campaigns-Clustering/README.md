Title: Customer Segmentation for Customized Marketing Campaigns

Developed in R language.

Objective: Find consumer segments for marketing campaigns.

Every company has a list of customers who have already purchased its product and/or service.
This company may not know which customer groups are due to similar characteristics:
(of purchase, payment, age, location, income, ...)

By grouping these customers we can design campaigns that are focused on the needs of 
that specific group.

Thus, the chances of success are much greater, not only to sell new products (or services), but to guarantee the purpose of that consumer.



Steps:

1. Collect the data to support this type of analysis. 

2. Perform an exploratory data analysis 
(to try to identify possible groups)

3. Data Pre-Processing

4. Determine the best number of clusters (with different tools)

5. Build the model with K-Means (Machine Learning Algorithm)

6. How to identify each customer within each cluster

7. Complete analysis and reporting to decision makers
